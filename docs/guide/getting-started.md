## Document Classifier

`Document classifier` is a set of functions that can classify pages with the same characteristics. For a blog developer, the same characteristics may exist between different pages as follows:

- Pages put in a directory (e.g. `_post`)
- Pages containing the same specific frontmatter key value (e.g. `tag: js`).

Of course, both of them may be related to another common requirement, `pagination`.

So, how to combine them skillfully? Next, let's take a look at how this plugin solve these problems.
